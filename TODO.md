#TO DO
Add test scripts to show that the function(s) work with different parameter combinations.
Add example script to illustrate usage.
Fix convergence issues for high-order derivatives being constrained.
Optimize for speed, check that global optimum is achieved.
Modify so that function is octave-ready (currently works with octave if the optim package is installed, but need to disable optimoptions construction)
